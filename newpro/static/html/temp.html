Vadapalani Murugan Temple is one of the most popular temples dedicated to Lord Murugan. Located in Vadapalani, Chennai, the temple is known for helping devotees finding solutions to life's problems. People come here seeking answers to their marital, academic, and professional problems. Many devotees claim that worshipping here has assisted them to get over the trouble and find peace in life. It is also believed that worshipping Lord Murugan here is as pious as praying to him at the original Palani temple. If someone is unable to visit the original abode, they can pay their respects here, and Murugan will bless them all the same.

Vadapalani Murugan Temple has its roots fixed in numerous legends and myths, especially about its founder and first priest Annaswamy Naikar. He had a dream about this deed he must do for his good as well as the benefit of the society, and thus he started worshipping Lord Murugan at his home instead of trying to find him elsewhere. This small shrine was later transformed into the colossal premise with multiple deities that you can see today. If you visit the temple on any of the days of the special festivals, you will get to see the popularity Murugan has in this place.
